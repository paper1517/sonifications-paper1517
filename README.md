# sonifications-paper1517

This is a temporary code repository for the paper [Revisiting transposed convolutions for interpreting raw waveform sound event recognition CNNs by sonification](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uecYQBshVYV), currently under review at ICLR 2022.

All the code is present, but we're in the process of adding detailed documentation and instructions for replicating our experiments, including exact commands used as well as pretrained models for all experiments.
Training was done on TPU devices, whereas evaluation and metrics calculation was done on a single local GPU.
Stay tuned!
